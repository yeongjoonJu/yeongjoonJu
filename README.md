## :smile: Profile

:mortar_board: *Affiliation*: [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Lab](http://pr.korea.ac.kr) in Korea University (2020~)

I'm researching efficient and effective in-context augmentation for multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
> Research direction: face generation (vision) $\rightarrow$ dialogue generation (NLP) $\rightarrow$ neural network debugging (XAI) $\rightarrow$ :sun_with_face: **language modeling for multimodalities (NLP)**
